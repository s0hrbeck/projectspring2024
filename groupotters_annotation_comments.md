# Findings about the annotation process

## a1
PAT_269_415_906
Hair is growing on the lesion, and the camera angle is askew/not as dead on as other images.

PAT_325_1506_999
Both skin and lesion are a very pale white skin color, so much that they almost blend together.

PAT_361_743_82
There’s blood on the lesion which makes it difficult to see the lesion exactly.

PAT_38_53_198
Blue areas that are hard to discern whether are pen marks or part of lesion.
 
PAT_71_145_971
Not segmented because I can’t see a lesion. 

PAT_91_356_456 
There’s multiple lesions and multiple pen marks. In one place it looks like there is pen marks on a lesion.

PAT_91_356_74 
There’s multiple lesions and multiple pen marks. In one place it looks like there is pen marks on a lesion.


## a4

Three of the images assigned to annotator a4 were skipped as it was deemed too difficult to see what was lesion and what was not. 

Other observations include that some pictures were quite blurry or had an otherwise bad quality. In some images there also was a large amount of hair which obscured the lesions. 

There was a large amount of different types of lesions. Some were noticeably easier to annotate than others.
